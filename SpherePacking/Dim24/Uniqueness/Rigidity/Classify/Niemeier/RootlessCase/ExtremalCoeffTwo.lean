# Coefficient computations for an extremal weight-12 modular form

This file computes the `q^2` coefficient of the weight-12 modular form `E₄^3 - 720 • Δ`.

Using the standard `q`-expansions of `E₄`, `E₆`, and `Δ`, we obtain the classical value
`196560`. These are purely modular-form computations; later files relate this coefficient to
theta-series shell counts.

## Main statements
* `E4_sq_q_exp_one`
* `extremal_weight12_q_exp_two`
