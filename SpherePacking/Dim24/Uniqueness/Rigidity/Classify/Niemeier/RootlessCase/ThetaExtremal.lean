# Theta series as an extremal weight-12 modular form

For an even unimodular rootless rank-24 lattice `L`, the theta series is a weight-12 modular form
with constant term `1` and vanishing `q` coefficient. In level `1`, this forces it to equal the
extremal modular form `E₄^3 - 720 • Δ`, and in particular its `q^2` coefficient is `196560`.

This file records the modular-form argument producing the `q^2` coefficient.
