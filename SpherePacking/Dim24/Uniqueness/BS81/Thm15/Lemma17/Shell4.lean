# BS81 Lemma 17: the shell `L₄` equals `2 • C`

In the equality case, `L := span_ℤ (2 • C)` is an integral lattice and `L₄` denotes its norm-`4`
shell. BS81 Lemma 17 identifies this shell with the scaled code:
`latticeShell4 C = twoCodeVectors C = {2 • u | u ∈ C}`.

The proof is a subset + cardinality argument: `twoCodeVectors C ⊆ latticeShell4 C`, and both sets
have cardinality `196560`.
