# BS81 Lemma 18(ii): 44 common neighbors in `L₄`

In the equality case, BS81 Lemma 17 identifies the norm-`4` shell with the scaled code
`L₄ = 2 • C`. This file proves BS81 Lemma 18(ii): if `u,v ∈ L₄` satisfy `⟪u, v⟫ = 0`, then there
are exactly `44` vectors `w ∈ L₄` such that `⟪u, w⟫ = ⟪v, w⟫ = 2`.

We reduce this to the corresponding statement in the code `C`, proved in
`SpherePacking.Dim24.Uniqueness.BS81.Thm14.CommonNeighbors44.Basic`.
