# Numerical parameters for the Witt design `S(5,8,24)`

This file records the concrete `λ_s` parameters for a Steiner system `S(5,8,24)`:
the numbers of blocks containing a given `s`-subset for `s = 1,2,3,4`, and the total number of
blocks.

Each statement is obtained from the general double-counting identity in `SteinerLambda.lean` by
plugging in `v = 24`, `k = 8`, `t = 5`.
