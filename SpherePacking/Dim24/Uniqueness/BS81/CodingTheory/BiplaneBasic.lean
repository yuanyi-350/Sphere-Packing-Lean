# Basic facts about the `2-(11,5,2)` biplane

We use a convenient axiomatisation matching the construction in
`paper/Notes/CodingTheory/golay_uniqueness_from_biplane.tex`:
we start from a family of `11` subsets of an `11`-set, each of size `5`, with constant pairwise
intersection size `2`. From this we derive the usual biplane parameters:
each point lies in exactly `5` blocks, and each pair of points lies in exactly `2` blocks.

* `Biplane.Structure.r`
