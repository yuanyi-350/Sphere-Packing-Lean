# A canonical biplane on `Fin 11`

This file defines an explicit `2-(11,5,2)` biplane structure on `Fin 11`, used as a fixed target
for reconstruction and uniqueness arguments. The distinguished block is
`{0,1,2,3,4}`, and the remaining ten blocks each contain exactly two points from this block and
three points from `{5,6,7,8,9,10}`.

The particular choice of explicit model is not important: any fixed biplane would serve as a
canonical target once uniqueness up to isomorphism is established.
