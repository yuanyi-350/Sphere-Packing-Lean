Verified integer coefficient table for `coeffVarphiNum` (first `50` coefficients).

We avoid expensive kernel evaluation of rational `q`-series coefficients by:
1) rewriting `coeffVarphiNum n` as an `Int`-cast of the explicit `ℤ` coefficient formula
   `coeffVarphiNumZ n` (see `Part08F_CoeffZModel.lean`);
2) computing the first `50` coefficients using truncated list arithmetic in `ℤ`;
3) discharging the finite table comparison by `decide` on small `ℤ` equalities.

### Integer table for `coeffVarphiNum`

This file computes the first `QN = 50` coefficients of `coeffVarphiNum` using truncated list
arithmetic in `ℤ`, and records the resulting table as `varphiNumCoeffsZ_table`. The main lemma
`coeffVarphiNum_eq_table` identifies `coeffVarphiNum n` with the `ℚ`-cast of the table entry for
all `n < QN`.
