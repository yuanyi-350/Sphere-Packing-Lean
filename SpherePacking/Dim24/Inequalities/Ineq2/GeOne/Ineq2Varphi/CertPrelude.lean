# Certificate: first 50 coefficients of `coeffVarphiNum`

We rewrite `coeffVarphiNum n` (a `ℚ` coefficient) as the cast of an explicit `ℤ` formula and
compute the first `NVarphi = 50` coefficients using truncated list arithmetic in `ℤ`.

## Main definitions
* `coeffVarphiNumZV` and `coeffVarphiNum_eq_cast`
* the truncated coefficient lists `coeffE2ListZV`, ... used downstream in the certificate
