# Certificate data for `varphi_num` truncation coefficients

This file defines the explicit `ℤ` list `coeffVarphiNumListZV` and proves the coefficientwise
identities needed to compare it with the expected truncation coefficient list from Appendix A.

## Main definitions
* `coeffVarphiNumListZV`

## Main statements
* `coeffZV_coeffVarphiNumList_eq`
