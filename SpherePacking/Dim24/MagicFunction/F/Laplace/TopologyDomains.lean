# Domains for Laplace/Fourier continuation

This file defines the half-plane domains used in the analytic continuation arguments for the
Laplace and Fourier profiles. It also provides basic topological facts (openness and
preconnectedness) and a small "frequently equal" lemma used with the analytic identity theorem.

## Main definitions
* `domainTwo`
* `domainPosNeTwo`

## Main statements
* `domainTwo_isPreconnected`
* `domainPosNeTwo_isPreconnected`
